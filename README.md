## How it works

2. Comment `/opire create $XXX` in the issue to set the reward
3. Share the link — contributors will find it

## Generate a Changelog

Use the included script to create a structured `CHANGELOG.md` from git commits since the latest tag.

```bash
./changelog.sh
```

Three-step setup:

1. Copy `changelog.sh` into any git repository.
2. Run `chmod +x changelog.sh` if needed.
3. Run `./changelog.sh` to write `CHANGELOG.md`.

The script groups commits into `Added`, `Fixed`, `Changed`, and `Removed`. It uses the latest git tag as the starting point when one exists, otherwise it reads the full history.

See `SAMPLE_CHANGELOG.md` for example output generated from this repository.
